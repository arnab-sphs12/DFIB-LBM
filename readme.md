# Direct Forcing Immersed Boundary Lattice Boltzmann code in 2D (DFIB-LBM)

The code was developed in 2017-2018 as part of my Master's work in Mechanical Engineering with specialisation in Fluid and Thermal Engineering, along with [Sambit Majumder](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sambit-Majumder) and under the supervision of [Dipankar N. Basu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dipankar-Basu-2) and [Ganesh Natarajan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ganesh-Natarajan-7).

The code is capable in solving fluid-particle interaction involving complex geometries in 2D. The code has been rigorously validated with multiple test cases present in literature. Some of the popular test cases are shown below:

## Pure Wake Interaction
